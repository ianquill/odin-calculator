# TODO

    - keyboard support
    - add footer
    - button hover and click 
    - delete initial values
    - add default display of 0?

# BUGS

    - overflow with decimals has some edge cases
        - lesson learnt: when you find this write down exactly how to replicate it, not sure if I fixed it or not
    
    - low priority: fix console error for clicking decimal when equals has calculated a number with a decimal
