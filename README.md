This project was created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It has num-pad support (I haven't figured out how to have multiple keys at the same time).

# BUGS

    - division with long decimal remainders is giving e-answers, round properly
    
    - overflow with decimals has some edge cases
        - lesson learnt: when you find this write down exactly how to replicate it, not sure if I fixed it or not
    
    - low priority: fix console error for clicking decimal when equals has calculated a number with a decimal
